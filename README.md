# ImageVariograms

The variogram is a tool commonly used in geostatistics. It allows the spatial variability within an image to be accounted for through feature structures and variations 

This tool would make it possible to know the size of elements in the image in pixels, failing to know the Ground Sampling Distance (the physical distance on the ground between the centers of two neighboring pixels in the image) in cm or m, depending on several parameters including the lens, the focal length and thus different for each dataset.
